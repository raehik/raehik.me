I came upon this gem of a game reading [K Mandla's post on it](https://inconsol

on) on his blog [Inconsolation](https://inconsolation.wordpress.com):
[`clmystery`](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery).

This is a game which requires you to regulate yourself -- the solution is
always close by, so you should only check it when you're sure of your answer!

In `clmystery`, you are tasked with trekking through all the data obtained by
officers on the scene. And there's a fair amount: **6.5 MB of text!** How to
parse all that effectively is your that is your own problem...

The game teaches essential command-line tools such as (hint!) `grep` and
`head`
