Here's another thing I've recently fallen victim to using: Last.fm and
its wonderful scrobbling feature.

[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm) is a big ol' music database (not like
[MusicBrainz](http://musicbrainz.org) in which the killer feature is
being able to record every track you listen to. The verb (and noun) they
term this as (?) is *scrobbling*. A *scrobble* is a track submission,
confirming that yes, you listened to a specific song at a specific time.

I love it so much because, hell, it's more statistics on myself. The
more and deeper I can understand myself the better, in my opinion.
Simple stuff like logging what songs I listen at what time seems like
a thing (?statistic, 'vector', ???) which could be useful to analyse.
Who knows, maybe it'll somehow come in handy for something like [my
recorded commands]({% post_url command-sleuthing %}).

If you're averse to other companies having and using your data but are
interested in scrobbling (i.e. logging music you listen to), then there
are some scrobblers out there which let you keep a local log too. The
main scrobbler I'm using, `mpdscribble`, can record your played songs in
a very simple log file as well as submitting to Last.fm, so there's
something to look at if you're a \*nix user.

I'm trying to test Last.fm's export feature, but they take ages to do
it. Boo -- it can't be more than 1,000 short entries in a database, can
it? Hrmph.
