`i3` is a fantastic window manager which gives you tons of options for
configuration. Accompanying the useful features is some great documentation.
However, there is one thing the [user's guide](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html)
doesn't go over much: **layouts**.

[Layouts](i3wm.org/docs/layout-saving.html) and autostarting programs allow you
to set out programs in a consistent manner every time you start i3. They're
some of the reasons I switched away from Ubuntu, since they aren't so great on
Unity or XFCE (or maybe I just didn't look hard enough! (?)). Since it's a very new feature in i3 (introduced in v4.8, my
current version), it doesn't have masses of good docs. To this end (? therefore), here are some of the things I've done
with my i3 config. (my latest one can be found in my [raehik/dotfiles](link to actual file in tree) repo)
