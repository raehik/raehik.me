I prefer using terminal programs to do as much as possible, because it
means I can use them remotely over a simple (low bandwidth) SSH
connection. Plus the ease of transferring configs. And I'll admit that I
find it pretty funny how much it makes me look like a hacker to
non-Linux people :D

There are a few programs which I think people most *expect* to be
GUI-based: e.g.  file managers, editors, and email clients (or MUAs if
you want to be fancy). But don't be deceived! Some really great
terminal-based replacements exist for pretty much any program you might
want to use.  Here are a couple recommendations I have:


Mutt: email, but in a terminal
------------------------------

[Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) is a well-known text-based email client
*(or more properly, a mail user agent (MUA))*.  It's very confusing and
hard to get started with (I've been configuring it to make everything
come together for at least a week), but the cute ASCII logo featured on
[the wiki](http://dev.mutt.org/trac/wiki/MuttWiki) makes up for
everything.

Vim: sorry Emacs noobs
----------------------

[Vim]() is the program which executes a random action every time you
press a key. At least, that's what it seems like until you try learning
a thing or two about its operation. tl;dr it's a useful and incredibly
versatile editor... which is also how Emacs advocates describe Emacs, so
you can go with that if you want.






There're always more things to automate and make nicer with the
applications I'm using, but I'm currently quite comfortable with my
setup (in [raehik/dotfiles](https://github.com/raehik/dotfiles)).
