GUI-based: e.g.  file managers, editors, and email clients (or MUAs if
you want to be fancy). But don't be deceived! Some really great
terminal-based replacements exist for pretty much any program you might
want to use.  Here are a couple recommendations I have:

applications I'm using, but I'm currently quite comfortable with my
