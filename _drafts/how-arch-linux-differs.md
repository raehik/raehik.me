At [Young Rewired State](YRS) (more details on that later) I met a bunch of
people who were intrigued [sp?] at [??] the distro I was using, Arch Linux.
Many kids there used Ubuntu and 
[Arch Linux](Arch wiki) really is a mighty fine distro. The wiki is huge and
covers configuration for a **lot** of popular programs. The way that Arch Linux
is packaged and the wiki is formatted encourages users to not just learn how to
*use* but *understand* each program they use.
