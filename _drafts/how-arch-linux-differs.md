[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) is, in its own website's words, *"a
lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple."
It's great for learning about Linux and important low-level tools, and is also
super fast, but unlike most OSs it requires some effort by the user to
understand how to use it. That seems to be the thing which both pulls hackers
to it and pushes 'regular users' away from it.



is a mighty fine distro. The comprehensive wiki covers
configuration for a **lot** of popular programs, and not in an
Arch-specific way (e.g. one of the reasons I started using it was because I was
using the wiki for every Ubuntu problem I had). And then there's the speed, and
the beautiful portability of an Arch installation, and the cool colourscheme...

I've been using Arch for a couple of months. I love playing and learning about
different things I can do with it. No doubt you are interested in it, having
visited this post. But Arch is a little separate from more popular distros such
as Ubuntu: if you want to try out Arch Linux (and perhaps even make the
switch!), there are a couple things you might find different, and some you
might find confusing. Or at least, I did. Here's a short list of **how Arch is
different to other distros:**


1. Super flexible
-----------------

Arch Linux does not suggest to its users which programs to use - ***at all***.


2. You have to lrn2\*nix
------------------------

Some distros such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint try to make the switch from Windows
to Linux easy by doing things in a Windows-y way. For example, automatic device
mounting in Ubuntu, the *"wow! it's so easy!"* packaging, etc.

Arch Linux doesn't make switching easy by emulating the features users are used
to. Instead, they make it easy by providing masses of documentation on
everything and anything you might wish to use. Like, *everything*. It's really
one of the best (if not the best) Linux wikis out there.

The way that Arch Linux is packaged and the wiki formatted encourages (or
perhaps requires) users to *learn how to use* packages they install. Hardly any
non-essential programs are included with the base installation: not even `ntpd`
or `openssh`.


3. Experienced, helpful community
---------------------------------

*"A Linux community? Helpful?"* you might ask. Well, not necessarily *nice*
about it all the time, but the Arch community forums are a brilliant resource
for researching any issues you ever get.





At [Young Rewired State](YRS) (more details on that later) I met a bunch of
people who were intrigued [sp?] at [??] the distro I was using, Arch Linux.
Many kids there used Ubuntu and
