*(Note: I do not represent Arch Linux, and this isn't endorsed by them or
anything.)*

[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) is, in its own website's words, *"a
lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple."
It's great for learning about Linux and important low-level tools, and is also
super fast, but unlike most operating systems it requires some effort by the
user to understand how to use it. That seems to be the thing which pulls
hackers to it at the same time as pushing 'regular' users away from it.

I've been using Arch for a couple of months. I love playing and learning about
different things I can do with it. But there are a couple places where it diverts from your 'mainstream' Linux distribution
different, and some you things might find confusing. Or at least, that happened to me. Here's a short list of **how Arch is
different to other distros:**

This article aims to point out the differences a 'regular' user (Linux or
Windows) might find in Arch Linux compared to more common distros such as
Debian or Ubuntu, and, rather than give workarounds, explain why these
differences are present -- because it's usually for a reason.




is a mighty fine distro. The comprehensive wiki covers
configuration for a **lot** of popular programs, and not in an
Arch-specific way (e.g. one of the reasons I started using it was because I was
using the wiki for every Ubuntu problem I had). And then there's the speed, and
the beautiful portability of an Arch installation, and the cool colourscheme...



1\. Super flexible
-----------------

Betcha you didn't know about the `zeitgeist` package in Ubuntu, eh? Well, it's not
something you're meant to mess with -- and it's not easily removed.

Arch Linux does not force any packages on to its users - ***at all***.
You are encouraged to do research on what you need and which programs might do
that.


2\. You have to lrn2\*nix
------------------------

Some distros such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint try to make the switch from Windows
to Linux easy by doing things in a Windows-y way. For example, automatic device
mounting in Ubuntu, the *"wow! it's so easy!"* packaging, etc.

Arch Linux doesn't make switching easy by emulating the features users are used
to. Instead, they provide masses of documentation on
everything and anything you might wish to use. Like, *everything*. It's really
one of the best (if not the best) Linux wikis out there.

The way that Arch Linux is packaged and the wiki formatted encourages (or
perhaps requires) users to *learn how to use* packages they install. Hardly any
non-essential programs are included with the base installation: not even `ntpd`
or `openssh`.


3\. Experienced, helpful community
---------------------------------

*"A Linux community? Helpful?"* you might ask. Well, not necessarily *nice*
about it all the time, but the Arch community forums are a brilliant resource
for researching any issues you ever get.





At [Young Rewired State](YRS) (more details on that later) I met a bunch of
people who were intrigued [sp?] at [??] the distro I was using, Arch Linux.
Many kids there used Ubuntu and
