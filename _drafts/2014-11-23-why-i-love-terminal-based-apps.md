So I've being playing with Mutt for a few months now. It's very
confusing compared to the other mail programs I've used before. Like,
**esoteric confusing**:

  * You want a sidebar? [Download a patch](LINK) and compile it
    yourself.
  * You want colour? Do it yourself: `man muttrc` only tells you the
    syntax.

It's not usually expected for a program such as a mail reader to take so
long to understand, yet Mutt has taken me weeks to become accustomed to.
Of course the points above won't feel like new things to the older \*nix
users (indeed they're becoming everyday tasks for me too), but such
heavy configuration scares lots of (read: non-masochist) people away.

With great configuration comes great personalisation, however, and this
is the reason I like terminal apps so much. I use the colours *I* want,
have the keybindings *I* use, and because of this I understand how to
use the program much better.

The other advantage to terminal programs is that they can be used over a
simple SSH connection. This I like because it's not infrequent that I
don't have access to a Linux machine and wish I did, so I simply
download [PuTTY](LINK) and sit contentedly (???).
