***tl;dr Want to keep a personal wiki using Jekyll? Check out my
[jekyll-wiki-template][repo] repo on GitHub.***

I'm not good at remembering lots of things. Either I forget them all, or I
concentrate so hard on keeping them on my mind that I can hardly focus on other
things. (Well, it's not that severe, but you get my point.)

Around 5 months ago I realised that I might benefit from keeping a [personal
wiki][] of sorts, where I could write whatever information I wanted and I would
know that if I ever needed to recall a piece of knowledge, I'd find it there. I
started out on November 15th using [vimwiki][] because it seemed neat and I'm
just a guy who likes Vim.

Later, I wrote [my own static site generator][wikify] which was *incredibly*
hacky and poorly-thrown together. I eventually moved to [Jekyll][], a great static
site generator written in Ruby. I separated my wiki pages from the templating
files and thus [**Jekyll wiki template**][repo] was born.

Development status
------------------

I'm working on the wiki template as I add to my own wiki using this template.
I've got a whole bunch of to-dos including adding 'templates' like Wikipedia
(e.g. biography template, video game console template, ...) and disambiguation
pages/tags. However, I don't actively update it. TODO
