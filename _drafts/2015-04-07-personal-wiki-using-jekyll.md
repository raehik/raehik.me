title: "Personal wiki using Jekyll"

Once upon a time around 5 months ago, having finally admitted to myself
that my memory is really quite poor, I decided that I'd make a little
'personal' wiki where I could note down things that I might need to
remember but that wouldn't belong in a journal/diary. I started out on
November 15th using [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
because I thought it was pretty cool, and I use Vim for a lot of my
work.

Eventually I moved to Jekyll, after finding out that writing your own
static site generator takes a bit of effort (if I can't write it in
Bash, I ain't writing it at all).

1: Why I wanted to do it
------------------------


2: Things (plugins) I needed to do it 
--------------------------------------


3: Progress & how pleased I am with it
--------------------------------------

bla bla bla...

Most recently, I've split development off into a separate 'framework'
repo, so I can share any code I've written without making my wiki
public. I'm a little hesitant to do so for now, since parts are somewhat
personal and it really can't be any use to anyone (yet).

Also, trying to streamline the writing process has prompted me to
develop some useful plugins and other things. The best examples I have
are my TOC generator and my shortlink renderer for Redcarpet.
