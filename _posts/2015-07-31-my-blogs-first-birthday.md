    initial commit
```

Looks like my blog will be **1 year old** in only 2 days! It's a little sad that
I didn't write much content -- but at the same time, it means I was able to work
on many other Jekyll projects, such as my [Jekyll wiki
template](https://github.com/raehik/jekyll-wiki-template) and setting up (and
actually using!) a Jekyll journal. Fun times!

I've got to get up to some more interesting things so I can write about them. I
spend an awful lot of time [playing][scripts] [with][markdown-render]
[short][new-from-template] [scripts][jctl], so I don't consider writing about
them. But I could well talk about my wiki template, or a selection of my
scripts (especially [file-render][] and using it in Vim). I don't want to sound
overly enthusiastic and subsequently fall flat before writing anything, so I'll
only tell myself that I have to jump into writing a post rather than thinking
about it as a draft initially.

Be expecting more posts in the coming 2 weeks! I have some old drafts to fluff
up.
