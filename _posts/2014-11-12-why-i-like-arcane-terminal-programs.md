I've being playing with Mutt for a few months now. It's very confusing.
Like, **esoteric confusing**. If you want to get any nice colour in there,
you'll have to find it yourself -- no colourscheme comes pre-enabled. If
you want a sidebar overview of all the folders in your email, you have
to *patch the source and compile it yourself*.

Of course these things won't feel like new things to the older Linux users
(indeed they're becoming everyday tasks for me too), but such heavy
configuration scares lots of people away.

With great configuration comes great personalisation, however, and this
is the reason I love my terminal apps so much. I use the colour *I*
want, have the keybindings *I* use, and because of this I understand how
to use the program much better.
