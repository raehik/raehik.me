I'm almost finished moving all my major programs over to a
terminal-based equivalent! Just set up mutt with offlineimap to work
with my Gmail account and it seems pretty fun.

My current list of interactive terminal apps in constant use includes:

  - [irssi](http://irssi.org/)
  - [calcurse](http://calcurse.org/)
  - [vim](http://www.vim.org/)
  - [mpd](http://www.musicpd.org/) + [ncmpcpp](http://ncmpcpp.rybczak.net/)
  - [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)

So I'm pretty set for when the graphical display rapture comes.
