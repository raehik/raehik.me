I'm almost finished moving all my major programs over to a
terminal-based equivalent! Just set up `mutt` with `offlineimap` to work
with my Gmail account and it seems eh alright.

My current list of interactive terminal apps in constant use includes:

  - irssi
  - calcurse
  - vim
  - mpd + ncmpcpp
  - mutt

So I'm pretty set for when the graphical display rapture comes.
