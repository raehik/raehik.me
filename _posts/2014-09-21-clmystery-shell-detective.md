I came upon this gem of a game reading [K Mandla's post on it](https://inconsol
ation.wordpress.com/2014/08/15/the-command-line-murders-no-its-not-an-applicati
on) on his blog [Inconsolation](https://inconsolation.wordpress.com):
[`clmystery`](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery).

`clmystery` presents you with a murder mystery which you, as a detective of
Terminal City, must solve. To do so, you must trek through all the data
obtained by officers on the scene. And there's a fair amount: **6.5 MB of
text!** How to parse all that effectively is your that is for your to figure
out...

The game teaches essential command-line tools such as `grep` and `head`
*(hint!)* in a very unique and absorbing way. I won't ruin anything, since it's
a very rewarding to finish it! Keep in mind `clmystery` requires you to
regulate yourself -- the solution is always close by, so you should only check
it when you're sure of your answer!
