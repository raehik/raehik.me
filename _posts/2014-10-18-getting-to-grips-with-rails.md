Rails is *scary*.

When you type `rails new`, lots of files with funny names appear. Things
like `Gemfile`, `config.ru` `vendor/`, `bin`... It's a little
overwhelming.

I didn't really factor in "learning Rails" into the time it would take
us to get something running in Setsura -- and that was a grave error,
considering we *finally made the project repo* about 6 months after we
received the money. (It was everyone's fault, we were all too lazy.)

For now, I'm focusing on learning about Rails and other MVC-esque web
frameworks (Node.js is cool too), so I can understand how we should do
stuff. Luckily there are like a billion Rails tutorials, so I'll bet we
can get some simple things running in a month!
